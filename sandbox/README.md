# Sandbox samples

All sandbox samples under this repository are minimal samples created to test Prism in a real application during development. This enables the team to proof and validate more complex functionality (e.g. navigation) without the need to create new NuGet packages during development. Expect these sandbox samples to break from time to time.

These samples are no replacement for the unit test suite that covers the code base.

# Stable samples

More complete and stable samples showing how to use Prism 6 for your application development will be posted in separate repositories under the [PrismLibrary GitHub organization](https://github.com/PrismLibrary). These samples are based on public released NuGet packages and are thus more stable than the sandbox samples. Guidance on specific scenarios can be found in these stable samples.
